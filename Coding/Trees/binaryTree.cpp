// Types of Binary Tree -
// 1) Full Binary Tree - Having exactly 0 or 2 children(not 1)
// 2) Perfect Binary Tree - Every node (except last level leaf node) has 2 child nodes.
// 3) Complete Binary Tree - Last level leaf node is missing from right most corner. If missing from left side or any other part than not complete binary tree.
// 4) Balance Binary Tree - For every node, the difference between the levels of left sub tree and the right subtree should be atmost one(that is either zero or one).
// 5) Degenerate and Skewed Binary Tree - For every node has atmost one child that is zero or one child.
