Dynamic Programming (DP) is optimized recursion
Types of DP - 
1) Recursion + Memoization - Top Down DP (Recursive Method)
2) Tabulation - Bottom Up DP (Iterative Method)

For competitive programming, we generally :
Make global dp vector, now in main function clear the dp vector -> dp.clear() then resize the dp with the length greater than given in constraint. If given length in constraint is 100000 then do -> dp.resize(100005 , -1)

Problems of DP consists of combinatorics(counting), finding maximum and minimum.
