Binary to decimal conversion ->
1) Start numbering from right to left starting from 0
2) That is at index 0 , it is 2^0. At index 2, it is 2^2.
3) Multiply 2 to the powers with its binary number digits respectively .
4) example - 0011 -> 2^3*0 + 2^2*0 + 2^1*1 + 2^0*1 = 3
4) Number of one increases in binary number , increases the decimal number is not always true . Example - 110000->48 and 101111->47.

To implement use a loop,
take a character then multiply 2^(n-i-1) and add to sum.

Or use a loop using bit manipulation technique.
