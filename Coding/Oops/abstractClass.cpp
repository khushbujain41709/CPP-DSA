// Abstract classes are those classes which has only pure virtual functions.
// pure virtual functions are those which has declaration(only) in base class and defination in derived class . Ex - virtual void showRoll() = 0;
// Once declared pure virtual function , it must be defined in its all derved class otherwise show error.
// We never make object of base class as it has pure virtual functions.

// If a class has only pure virtual function then it is a pure abstract class.
